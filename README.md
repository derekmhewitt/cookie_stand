CodeFellows 201 Cookie Stand Project

day4FeatureWork
On the agenda today is to work on a layout following Brian's demo as a guide and styling from there.  There are also some minor fixes to be done to my sales.html page and sales.js file.  

day3 - no branch on my repo for this
Was pair programming, so my work is primarily in my fork of Valerie's repo and hers is in her fork of mine, which have both been merged now.  But our development paths were very similar and focused on getting the input fields into each of our sales.html page.  

day2FeatureWork
Removed object literals from salesapp.js and replaced with constructor function.  Coded output for all object to cookie table.  

day1FeatureWork
Created individual pages and fleshing out basic structure.  Working on sales.html and salesapp.js mostly.

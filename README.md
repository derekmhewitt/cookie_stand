CodeFellows 201 Cookie Stand Project

day4FeatureWork
Major layout work, I used mostly Brian's layout template to style my page and ended up with something pretty similar.  Styled the table on sales.html as well.  Some JS edits to salesapp.js that cleaned up the code quite nicely.  

day3 - no branch on my repo for this
Was pair programming, so my work is primarily in my fork of Valerie's repo and hers is in her fork of mine, which have both been merged now.  But our development paths were very similar and focused on getting the input fields into each of our sales.html page.  

day2FeatureWork
Removed object literals from salesapp.js and replaced with constructor function.  Coded output for all object to cookie table.  

day1FeatureWork
Created individual pages and fleshing out basic structure.  Working on sales.html and salesapp.js mostly.
